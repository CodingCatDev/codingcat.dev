> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). Puppeteer runs [headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)Think of Playwright as being Puppeteer, but it works on all the browsers.

> Our primary goal with Playwright is to improve automated UI testing by eliminating flakiness, improving the speed of execution and offering insights into the browser operation.

## Ionic Gestures with Josh Morony[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/aj-s-week-in-web-january-22-2020#ionic-gestures-with-josh-morony)

> Creating this style of animation/gesture has always been possible in Ionic applications - you could use one of many libraries to help you, or you could have also implemented it from scratch yourself. However, now that Ionic is exposing their underlying gesture system for use by Ionic developers, it makes things significantly simpler. We have everything we need out of the box, without having to write complicated gesture tracking ourselves.

## Spec Flow[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/aj-s-week-in-web-january-22-2020#spec-flow)

[https://specflow.org/](https://specflow.org/)

> Use SpecFlow to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects. Writing easily understandable tests is a cornerstone of the BDD paradigm and also helps build up a living documentation of your system.

> Hear from inspiring speakers from the industry working on every aspect of the ecosystem — frontend frameworks, APIs, browsers, and more.

I attended backendlessconf live and it was an absolute thrill to see how conected our world has become. Especially when you are using no backend (well kinda) or physical location to join it all together.
