## What is Solid?

SolidJS is a modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was created by Ryan Carniato in 2018 and has gained a strong following in the open source JavaScript and web development community. SolidJS is based on the idea of reactive state, which means that components are only updated when their state changes.

### What are the Benefits of Solid?

It is designed to be efficient, flexible, and easy to use. SolidJS's reactivity gives SolidJS an advantage when it comes to performance, even for large applications. With support for a wide range of features including custom hooks, SSR, and Suspense, SolidJS is a great choice for building a wide variety of web apps.
