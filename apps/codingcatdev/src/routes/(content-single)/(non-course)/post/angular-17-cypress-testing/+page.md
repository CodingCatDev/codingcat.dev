Before I even get started on Cypress and Angular, I have to say the new design on [Angular.dev](https://angular.dev) looks incredible. It is full on conference season so I hope that they printed some kick ass [custom-stickers](https://www.stickermule.com/custom-stickers) from [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/) and are bringing them out to Vegas!

## Cypress JavaScript Testing

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a popular JavaScript end-to-end testing framework. It is known for being easy to use and fast. Cypress is also able to test Angular components.

**What is Angular component testing?**

Angular component testing is a type of testing that ensures that Angular components are working correctly. Angular components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. They encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

**Why use Cypress for Angular component testing?**

There are many reasons to use Cypress for Angular component testing. Some of the benefits include:

- Cypress is easy to use and learn.
- Cypress is fast and performant.
- Cypress supports many Angular features, including directives, pipes, and services.
- Cypress can be used to test Angular components in isolation or in the context of a larger application.

**Getting started with Cypress component testing**

To get started with Cypress component testing, you will need to install Cypress and the Cypress Angular support package. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install cypress -D
```

Once Cypress is installed, you can create a new test file. For example, you could create a file called `stepper.component.cy.ts`. This file will contain the tests for your stepper component.

**Writing your first Angular component test**

The following code snippet shows how to write a simple test for a stepper component:

```ts
import { StepperComponent } from './stepper.component';

describe('StepperComponent', () => {
	it('should render the stepper component', () => {
		cy.mount(StepperComponent);
	});
});
```

This test will check that the stepper component is created and that it is visible.

**Advanced topics in Angular component testing**

There are many advanced topics in Angular component testing. Some of these topics include:

- Testing Angular components with data binding
- Testing Angular components with RxJS
- Testing Angular components with router
- Testing Angular components with Angular Material

If you are interested in learning more about these topics, I recommend checking out the Cypress documentation.

## Conclusion

Angular component testing is an important part of developing Angular applications. Cypress is a powerful tool for Angular component testing. It is easy to use, fast, and supports many Angular features. I hope this blog post has helped you get started with Angular component testing with Cypress.
