## About

Ben is a web developer from McKinney, Texas. His teammates know him for his commitment to web accessibility, intentional inclusiveness, and unforgivable puns.

Ben believes in writing the code you wish to see in the world—taking pride in the work you do and celebrating code for just how human it is.

Ben is passionate about learning and growing, and is just as passionate about sharing what he has learned with those around me.
