## About

Jesse is a Senior Developer Advocate at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Jesse also has a widely successful YouTube show called codeSTACKr, teaching web development tutorials. I would not be doing it justice if I didnâ€™t also mention the [weekly news](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkwxH9e_vrALgl3pq8qb_PSKVO5201z-D) as well.
