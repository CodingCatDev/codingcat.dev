### About

I've got lots of experience with React, React Native and have been diving deep into the JamStack and serverless architecture. My main focus is e-commerce and am currently maintaing my first Open Source library [use-shopping-cart](https://github.com/dayhaysoos/use-shopping-cart), a Stripe powered Hooks library for handling shopping cart state and logic.
