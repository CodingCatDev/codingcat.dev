## About

I am an energetic, entrepreneurial leader, and strategic organizer with a track record of significant project and fundraising success. I have a unique ability to understand complex issues, communities and networks quickly and leverage that knowledge to develop and implement strategies to advance public policy issues.

I am a direct, compelling public speaker who serves well as the face and public representative of mission organizations. I am skilled at persuasive communications and have the ability to write, work with and utilize all media tools, including social media, to advance projects and causes.

I am a seasoned supervisor with capacity to motivate, monitor and evaluate staff across multiple functions and sites.
