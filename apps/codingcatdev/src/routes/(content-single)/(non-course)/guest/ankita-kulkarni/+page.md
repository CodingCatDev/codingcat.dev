## About

[Next.js Course](https://kulkarniankita.com/courses/next.js)

I’m a Technical leader that transitioned in Engineering Management so I’ve seen what it means to grow to a Solution Architect as well as Senior Engineering Manager (Was on track to become a director) but didn’t want to climb the ladder. I got let go last year so I decided to work for myself and teach as that has been a passion of mine. I have been meaning to do this for a while but decided to go all in. I'm passionate about teaching front-end technologies and growing people in their careers.

I have over 10 years of experience in the tech industry, starting with helping small businesses develop apps. I transitioned from a Senior Developer to a Solution Architect, aka Staff Developer and then decided to transition to leadership. I have been leading teams and helped define the future of FinTech in Canada.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Solution Architect, and Lead developer at companies such as WealthSimple, Loblaw Digital, [Rangle.io](https://rangle.io) and IBM Canada. I have architected and scaled many web and mobile apps for clients using React, GraphQL, React Native and Next.js. Here are a few: Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, Borrowell, WealthSimple, Moleskine and more.

I also enjoy teaching and public speaking, so I created a course on Next.js and love giving conference talks worldwide! You can check it out here: [https://bit.ly/3nRIsbi](https://bit.ly/3nRIsbi)
