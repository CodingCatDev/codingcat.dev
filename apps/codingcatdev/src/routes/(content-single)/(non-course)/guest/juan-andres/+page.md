## About

My name is Juan Andrés Núñez, and my passion is to transmit my specialized knowledge in JavaScript and Vue.js to anyone who is interested in learning frontend web development, either in person or online. My pedagogical approach is based on a holistic perspective that is not limited to technical skills, but also emphasizes the importance of personal skills or soft skills.
