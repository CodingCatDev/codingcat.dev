### About

Brian Douglas is a member of the Developer Relations team at [GitHub](https://github.com) where I work on the increasing use of GitHub and its API by fostering a community of early adopters through the developer programs. In the past, heâ€™s lead Developer Advocacy and Front-end development at Netlify, where I sat in a hybrid role as Frontend Engineer and Developer Advocate.
