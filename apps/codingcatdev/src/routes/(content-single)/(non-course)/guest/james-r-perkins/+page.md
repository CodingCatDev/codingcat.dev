## About

Hi, I’m James.

I’m currently at [Clerk](https://clerk.com), where I lead our Developer Experience. I focus on creating a developer experience that is first class by focusing on support, documentation and education.

---

I’m passionate about many creative pursuits, including photography, videography (both creating and editing), and of course, coding. This combination of interests is what led me to my current role at Clerk and why I left my previous role at [Plaid](https://plaid.com) as an developer support engineer manager.

Outside of Clerk, I create a lot of content on YouTube and here on this blog, but I also do consulting work, helping companies create their developer relations team, or provide guidance on how to create content, or how to build a community.

If you’re interested in working with me, or just want to chat, feel free to [reach out](mailto:james@jamesperkins.dev), or book a [consultation call with me](https://cal.com/james-perkins/consult).
