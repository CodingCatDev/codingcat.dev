## Profile

[April Wensel](http://twitter.com/aprilwensel) is an international keynote speaker, software engineer, and technical leader whose varied career spans such fields as education, research, healthcare, and entertainment.

After a decade in the tech industry, she founded Compassionate Coding in order to bring more compassion to the software development process through team and individual training.

Away from the keyboard, she enjoys gleaning fruit, running ultramarathons, and cooking vegan food—because animals deserve our compassion, too!
