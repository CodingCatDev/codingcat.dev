## About

Max Howell is the CEO of [tea.xyz](http://tea.xyz) and creator of Homebrew. Brew was one of the largest open source projects of all time, with tens of millions of users to this day.

For his contributions to the world of development, he was compensated extremely sparsely (a blanket from Google and an iPad from Square), so he set out to make tea: a new, better package manager than brew that utilizes web3 technology to remunerate value back to open source devs.
