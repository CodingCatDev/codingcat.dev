3. Why is GraphCMS different from all the other CMS's out there?

   1. Depending on what learner you are, I found Jamie's intro video really useful for me when starting out building a project the last two weeks: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylmd737tw5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylmd737tw5w)
   2. There's also the GraphCMS blog and the GitHub examples repo: [https://github.com/GraphCMS/graphcms-examples](https://github.com/GraphCMS/graphcms-examples)
