## What is MDX?

[https://mdxjs.com/](https://mdxjs.com/)

[Markdown for the component era](https://mdxjs.com/#markdown-for-the-component-era)

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast ðŸš€.

## Questions

1. Why would you use regular markdown?
1. What makes MDX so powerful?
1. If you have HTML tags in md do they need to be converted to JSX?
1. How do you get compilation at Build Time, if a component is used?
1. How does MDX perform at scale?
1. Digital Gardenâ€™s with MDX, what framework would you recommend to get started with one right now?
1. So, youâ€™ve created a new ESM first framework built on Preact called Toast. Is MDX built into it out of the box? [https://www.toast.dev/](https://www.toast.dev/)
