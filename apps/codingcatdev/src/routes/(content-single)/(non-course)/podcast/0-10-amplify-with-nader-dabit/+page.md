## Questions

What is AWS Amplify?

Do you see more people using AppSync vs. API Management?

We have had a hard time differentiating DynamoDB Scan/Query from what actually gets filtered through AppSync, any perspectives on how to avoid common issues with this?

Is there a way to debug using \` amplify mock function \` in VSCode with 4.18.0??

Do you recommend using Cloudfront to serve S3 images for your Amplify hosted site?

## Future

I know the video plugin is coming along, are there any other cool features coming out for Amplify that people should know about?
