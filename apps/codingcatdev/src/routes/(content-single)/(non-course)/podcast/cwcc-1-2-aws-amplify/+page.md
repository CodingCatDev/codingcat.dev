AWS Amplify has introduced its next generation, Amplify Gen2, offering a fullstack development experience that's more code-first. This upgrade allows developers to use TypeScript or JavaScript skills for building and deploying fullstack apps. Key features include TypeScript-first backend libraries, file-based convention for transparency, per-developer cloud sandbox environments for rapid iteration, and a unified management console. It also includes fullstack Git branches, AWS CDK integration, form generation, support for monorepo and multi-repo, custom pipelines, and centralized secret management. This evolution aims to enhance local development, team collaboration, and flexibility in deployment workflows.

For a detailed overview, you can read the full blog post on [AWS's website](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/introducing-amplify-gen2/).
