## Questions

1. Tell us about yourself and how you found your way onto team Gatsby?
2. Gatsby version 3 was released in March 2021, was there so much that changed by October 2021 that you needed a new version?
   [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/)
3. What is new with Gatsby 4?
   - [Parallel Query Running](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.0/#parallel-query-running) - up to 40% reduction in build times
   - [Deferred Static Generation (DSG)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.0/#deferred-static-generation-dsg) - defer page generation to user request, speeding up build times
   - [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.0/#server-side-rendering-ssr) - pre-render a page with data that is fetched when a user visits the page
4. Data later, why GraphQL and will there be an option for rest?
5. What build tools is Gatsby looking at for builds?
6. [GatsbyConf](https://gatsbyconf.com/) is March 2nd & 3rd, 2022, high level what can we expect?
