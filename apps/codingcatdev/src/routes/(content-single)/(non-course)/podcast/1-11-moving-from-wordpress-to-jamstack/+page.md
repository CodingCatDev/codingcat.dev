1. What is Jamstack and what does it mean to you?
1. You always hear WordPress holds 30% of the internet. Is this still the case and are we starting to see them lose ground? Why do you think that is?
1. What are the benefits of moving off of WordPress and into a Jamstack ecosystem?
1. Is Jamstack lacking any capabilities that WordPress provides?
1. We are currently building out a backend similar to WordPress with the Jamstack in NextJS. What would you say are the key features WordPress provides its users?
1. If you were to use any CMS today to create a Next.js application and host it on Netlify what would it be? And why?
1. Can Netlify host a Next.js application with regeneration capabilities yet?
