## Questions

What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Why would you want to adopt IaC?

- Who made changes to the code
- Ticket that was linked
- Collaboration
- Documentation

Does IaC document your infrastructure?

Does IaC allow for solid Dev Ops?

## Pulumi

What is Pulumi?

What makes Pulumi different than

- Serverless Framework - [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/serverless/
  ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/serverless/)
- Cloud Formation - [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/cloud \_ templates/
  ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/cloud_templates/)
- Terraform - [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/terraform/
  ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/terraform/)
- Arm

Will IaC take longer?

- Should it be used for an MVP?
- How large of a team would you have before using IaC?
- Is it worth the time to set up if it is just something quick.

Is Pulumi good for single code shops that know only a single language?

- Speed to market is easier.
- No need to learn markup language

How big is the learning curve of IaC?

- Serverless is YAML

Pulumi support “ecosystems”

- NodeJS
- Go
- .Net
