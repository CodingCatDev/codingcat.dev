## Questions

1. Can you tell us more about yourself?
2. Can you tell us what dev is like in Nigeria? It seems to be getting bigger every month.
3. How does someone typically use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)?
4. How is [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) different than
   1. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
   2. [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)
   3. [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
5. Does CodeSandbox have plans to move to web containers vs spinning up Docker containers?
