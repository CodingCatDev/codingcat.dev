**[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. 

In this course, we will learn how to utilize the powerful features of Next.js. like API routes and Static Site Generation (SSG), to build full-stack React apps. 

Finally, we will import and deploy our project from GitHub to **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**
