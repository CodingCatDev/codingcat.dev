Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that is quickly gaining popularity among web developers. It is known for its small bundle size, high performance, and simple syntax.

Svelte is a compiler, not a library. This means that it compiles your code to native JavaScript, which results in smaller bundle sizes and better performance. Svelte also uses a virtual DOM, which means that it only updates the parts of the DOM that need to be updated, which further improves performance.

Svelte's syntax is very simple and easy to learn. It is similar to HTML, with a few extensions for things like state and events. Svelte also has a number of built-in components, such as buttons, inputs, and lists.
