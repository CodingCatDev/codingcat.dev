## About

Elena is the Founder & Head of Engineering of Holopin, a Web2 platform that uses digital badges and gamification to make recognition fun and _really_ cool. With a background in Developer Experience consulting in the Cloud and API tooling space, as well as managing partnerships for one of the world's largest developer tool programs at GitHub Education, Elena is an expert in empowering developers and building strong communities. When she's offline, you can find her drumming or brushing up on her language skills - she's fluent in three, and can read children's books in three more.
