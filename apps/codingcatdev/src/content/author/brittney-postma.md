## About

I love developing beautiful, fluid, and responsive websites using the Jamstack. I thrive on UI/UX development with an extensive knowledge of front-end libraries React, Redux, and Svelte, and I specialize in CSS and TailwindCSS. I have a background in Graphic Design and love diving into new projects. I provide accessibility first semantic HTML and make sure users will have a wonderful experience using your site!
