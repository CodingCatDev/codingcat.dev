Hey there Purr-fect Peep, so you have decided to start learning Web Development, that is **AWESOME**!! AJ and I will be here to guide you along in this journey. Whether you are ten, twenty or ninety years old, it is never too late to get started ????.

## Main Coding Environment[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/html-for-a-10-year-old/html-coding-tools#main-coding-environment)

Throughout the tutorials you will see tiny editors like below from CodeSandbox.

## CodeSandbox Login[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/html-for-a-10-year-old/html-coding-tools#codesandbox-login)

CodeSandbox uses an identity provider called [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can signup on GitHub using any email that you choose, just make sure you will have access to it long term. For instance if you are in school now and your email will be shutdown when you finish, consider creating an email address on [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/#). Please see the video for reference.

## CodeSandbox Fork[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/html-for-a-10-year-old/html-coding-tools#codesandbox-fork)

You can think of a fork as a copy of my original code, that you can make all your own. When you get started withe the basics it might not make sense to create forks of my sandboxes because you are just learning and playing around. However, when you get into some more advanced courses you will want to start forking your own solutions and even using those in GitHub so that you can show off your work.

> Pro Tip: Employers looking for coders will often look at your GitHub repo to checkout your work. This way you have something to show them.

## Where are all AJonP's Sandboxes[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/html-for-a-10-year-old/html-coding-tools#where-are-all-ajonps-sandboxes)

You can find all of AJonP's sandboxes at [https://codesandbox.io/u/ajonp/sandboxes](https://codesandbox.io/u/ajonp/sandboxes). This is also where you would find a listing of all your sandboxes as well, just replace ajonp with your username.
