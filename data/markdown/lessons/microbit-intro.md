## What is a micro:bit[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/microbit-for-a-10-year-old/micro-bit-intro#what-is-a-microbit)

It is a pocket-sized computer 70 times smaller and 18 times faster than the original BBC Micro computers used in schools.

- It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used to create games.
- There are two programmable buttons that can be used to control games or pause and skip songs on a playlist.
- It has an accelerometer so it can detect motion and knows when you're on the move.
- The built-in compass knows which direction you're heading in and...
- It can use a low energy Bluetooth connection to interact with other devices and the Internet. You can find more information on the hardware in our guide.

Inside (if you purchased the BBC micro:bit go) you will find a micro:bit, usb cable, and battery pack.

## Hook micro:bit to Computer[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/microbit-for-a-10-year-old/micro-bit-intro#hook-microbit-to-computer)

All you need to do is plug a usb A into your computer, then place the micro USB type B into your micro:bit

## Makecode[](https://codingcat.dev/courses/microbit-for-a-10-year-old/micro-bit-intro#makecode)

[](https://microbit.org/)[https://microbit.org](https://microbit.org) is the main site but there is an area that will take you to [](https://makecode.microbit.org/)[https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/) which is the main site to start programming your new micro:bit.Start with something basic like the flashing heart, this will provide you with an awesome interactive guide to start learning.

With the latest update you can select which language you would like to learn and start a tutorial, for younger kids I would recommend Blocks. Since we focus a lot on web solutions at CodingCatDev I would recommend using the JavaScript tutorial as well.
