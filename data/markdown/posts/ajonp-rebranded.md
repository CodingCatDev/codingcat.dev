# AJonP - Purr-fect Solutions

Something was a miss with my old site, I just couldn't care to ever update it. I was bored by trying to constantly fight with Wordpress issues, updates, plugins...At the same time I was hanging around my favorite Slack channel [Angular Firebase](https://angularfirebase.slack.com/) and [Jeff](https://twitter.com/angularfirebase) mentions he is building an awesome CMS with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), called [fireship.io](http://fireship.io/).My initial thought was I am an Angular developer, why would I go back to creating static sites, are people ???? ???? crazy!?!That is when it struck me, all the complaints about setting up [SEO](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html), [Angular Universl](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/server-side-rendering-firebase-angular-universal/) and having a good version control with a small footprint for a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) could be solved with using [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/).

# Let the fun begin

## The Mascot

So I jumped in (probably head first and too fast), I decided I wanted something to represent coding. I always meant for AJONP to mean Alex Jon on Programming. But I started sketching things out on my idea notepad, and had a basset hound wearing an Angular logo collar. I showed it to my wife, she said, why don't you make it a cat, since we have a cat.

So I shifted left and started trying to learn some basic Photoshop skills to make the Cat named AJ. I learned very quickly that I should apprectiate designers more because my logo is pretty rough, but it works for now ????.

## The Youtube Logo Sting

I did some digging about creating my own YouTube bumper, which I learned is called a "sting" and purchased one from [Videohive](https://videohive.net/tags/logo%20sting). I edited a few things by adding my logo and some basic title/colors.

# Try less, learn more.

Now after having done all that, [Jeff](https://twitter.com/angularfirebase) had it all made simple right here and I missed it!
