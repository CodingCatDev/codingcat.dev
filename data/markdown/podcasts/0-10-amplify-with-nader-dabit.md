## **Questions**

**What is AWS Amplify?**

**Do you see more people using AppSync vs. API Management?**

**We have had a hard time differentiating DynamoDB Scan/Query from what actually gets filtered through AppSync, any perspectives on how to avoid common issues with this?**

**Is there a way to debug using \`amplify mock function\` in VSCode with 4.18.0??**

**Do you recommend using Cloudfront to serve S3 images for your Amplify hosted site?**

## **Future**

**I know the video plugin is coming along, are there any other cool features coming out for Amplify that people should know about?**
