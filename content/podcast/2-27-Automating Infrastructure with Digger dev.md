## Questions

1. Tell us more about yourself and how Digger started?
2. Can you explain PaaS?
3. Is Digger Comparable to AWS Amplify?
4. Are the stacks maintained with Terraform which turns into Cloudformation?
5. It seems like much of the Stack could be serverless, but other parts will need to run full EC2 instances, how is that handled?
6. For something like Next.js where the lambdaâ€™s are to be created using their API folder, is this easily managed?
