### July

- This one hit late so I put it in July - SolidJS releases [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
Never heard of it checkout the [perf chart](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/javascript-frameworks-performance-comparison-2020-cd881ac21fce) Ryan Carniato wroteup.
- Qwik finally becomes a thing with a big update [version 0.0.12](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/releases/tag/v0.0.12-0). We got to record with [MiÅ¡ko Hevery](https://twitter.com/mhevery) in [Qwik the HTML First Framework](https://codingcat.dev/podcast/1-49-qwik-the-html-first-framework), checkout the Demo in that one at minute [19:30](https://youtu.be/vmUvYC80N0Q?t=1170).
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) was released in Technical Preview and half of all our jobs were lost. It seemed harmless [at first](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/).
- [Svelte Storm](https://arronnestor.medium.com/sveltestorm-sveltes-first-ide-83ad1f1a9803) was announced, pretty sure you will have to ask Brittney what this is all about.

### August

- GitHub comes out with another banger, [GitHub Code Spaces](https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/). These are fast VMâ€™s (maybe faster than your Mac, well at least my sonâ€™s Mac) that you can run VSCode in. Stay on those individual accounts though, otherwise hanging out and searching Stack Overflow could cost you a pretty penny. Oh yeah and did I say banger, see why in the Newsletters section below.

- Well the Angular team was not kidding, good bye View Engine! Angular version 13 removes View Engine, standardized on ES2020, no more `ngcc`  , good bye IE11 (so happy for this), and components no longer need `ComopnentFactoryResolver` !
