## Questions

First talk to me about this Kaggle thing, what is it?

Did you get started on tutorials because of [https://codediode.io/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625101633/https://codediode.io/) ?

What made you start angular firebase, which eventually became fireship?

Did you ever think you would be able to make a career out of making Tutorials?

I have been a lifetime Pro Member on your channel and have never regretted it for a minute, it has helped push me as a dev expert and taught me countless things I didn’t know.

What do you think it is that makes your tutorials so easy to digest?

At this point what do you think you like doing more

*   Creating code
*   Creating vids

I am trying to find out how to become a GDE in 2020, I know you have a whole video on what it took to find that path. [https://youtu.be/IDZyZMYn3H0](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625101633/https://youtu.be/IDZyZMYn3H0)

What do you think is the biggest part of becoming a GDE:

*   Tutorials
*   Public Speaking
*   Meetups

## Future

Do you think Flutter will continue to grow as fast as it has?
Do you think Angular 9 (Ivy) is a game changer?

Random Thoughts

I noticed that we are both PADI certified, we need to plan a trip!
