## Questions

1. Can you tell us more about yourself?
2. What is the focus of [PrestonWernerVentures](https://twitter.com/PWVentures)?
3. How did Redwood get started?
4. When you compare the integration of GraphQL and Apollo server, can someone coming from Gatsby easily understand how the data is managed?
5. Can you breakdown what [Cells](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cells) are, and how someone might use them?
6. Are authentication providers built into Redwood?
7. I probably know Redwood best from the community that is surrounding Redwood. Would you say that this was a focus day one?
8. RedwoodJS Startup Fund
9. ~~Why would you choose Redwood over something like Next/Remix? What about Django and Laravel?~~
10. ~~Will Redwood ever migrate away from GraphQL to something like tRPC?~~
11. ~~Is Redwood scalable for long term growth?~~
12. ~~Where do you see Redwood fitting into the landscape of JS Frameworks in the next 5 years?~~
