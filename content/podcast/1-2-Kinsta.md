## **Why CodingCatDev Switched Hosting Providers**

[**https://codingcat.dev/kinsta-saved-codingcatdevs-lms-dream-after-3-others-failed/**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625102244/https://codingcat.dev/kinsta-saved-codingcatdevs-lms-dream-after-3-others-failed/)

## **General Questions**

**What is the difference between shared hosting, VPS, or dedicated hosting?**

**Why did Kinsta decide to use the shared container approach?** [**https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/#4-improved-performance?kaid=XIIHFPADWOKE**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625102244/https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/#4-improved-performance?kaid=XIIHFPADWOKE)

**Is this mainly for security, or speed or reliability?**

\*\*Is pricing the biggest deciding factor for moving to GCP?

## Is this savings passed to the customer? Let’s say that GCP gets even cheaper will my bill go down?\*\*

## **Performance**

**With CodingCatDev we have LearnDash LMS as well as Buddy Boss, both of these use heavy transactional data, would it be possible to use something faster for the database?**

What is MariaDB [**https://mariadb.org/**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625102244/https://mariadb.org/)**?**

## **Why Kinsta?**

**What is the real** [**difference**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210625102244/https://kinsta.com/why-us/?kaid=XIIHFPADWOKE) **between Kinsta and someone else?**
