## Subject

Migrating from WordPress to Jamstack.

### Questions

*   **What is Jamstack and what does it mean to you?**
*   **You always hear WordPress holds 30% of the internet. Is this still the case and are we starting to see them lose ground? Why do you think that is?**
*   **What are the benefits of moving off of WordPress and into a Jamstack ecosystem?**
*   **Is Jamstack lacking any capabilities that WordPress provides?**
*   **We are currently building out a backend similar to WordPress with the Jamstack in NextJS. What would you say are the key features WordPress provides its users?**
*   **If you were to use any CMS today to create a Next.js application and host it on Netlify what would it be? And why?**
*   **Can Netlify host a Next.js application with regeneration capabilities yet?**
