## Questions

1. Can you tell us about your background and how you landed at Vercel?
2. New Feature highlights
    - **[Rust Compiler](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#faster-builds-and-fast-refresh-with-rust-compiler)**: ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds
    - **[Middleware (beta)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#introducing-middleware)**: Enabling full flexibility in Next.js with code over configuration
    - **[React 18 Support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#preparing-for-react-18)**: Native Next.js APIs are now supported, as well as Suspense
    - **`[<Image />`Â AVIF Support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#smaller-images-using-avif)**: Opt-in for 20% smaller images
    - **[Bot-aware ISR Fallback](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#bot-aware-isr-fallback)**: Optimized SEO for web crawlers
    - **[Native ES Modules Support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#es-modules-support-and-url-imports)**: Aligning with the standardized module system
    - **[URL Imports (alpha)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#url-imports)**: Import packages from any URL, no installs required

3. Will I notice much speed difference with the Rust Compiler on a smaller site (100 pages)?
4. Lets talk a lot about Serverless functions vs. Edge Functions running on V8. It seems like this might have some pretty specific use cases.

5. To keep memory low you will probably want to do a lot of streaming of data correct
