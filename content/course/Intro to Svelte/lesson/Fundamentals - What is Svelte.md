## **What is Svelte?**

Svelte is a component framework that allows you to break up your application into reusable chunks and provides some sugary syntax, making your code base easy to understand and very graceful.

Svelte is similar to React & Vue, with one key difference, there is NO VIRTUAL DOM. Instead of shipping the framework to the browser and letting it do the work, Svelte compiles itself away during a build step into vanilla html, css, and js. Making it one of the leanest frameworks out there

If you have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will feel right at home with Svelte. Having just a basic understanding is all that you need and we’ll cover everything else in this course. Next let’s take a look at what we’ll be using to write our applications.
