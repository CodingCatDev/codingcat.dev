## Why SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a framework that is built on top of the Svelte language compiler that gives you amazing benefits out of the box.

There is file system based routing, CSS scoping by default, the ability to disable JavaScript, and code-splitting that breaks up your app into small, digestible chunks that make the startup times blazing fast.

It also gives you the flexibility to render your content however you need, making it incredibly easy to build small apps or extensive, complex projects that scale.

SvelteKit is a full stack framework that brings the client and the server together with access to API endpoints to give you the best of both worlds.

SvelteKit is the fastest way to build Svelte applications and you will learn why in this course.
