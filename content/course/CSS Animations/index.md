## Letâ€™s Have Fun!

Why would you want to learn something boring, why not learn about raining cats, dogs, and unicorns! You will find examples of fun animations that you can take away with you in your projects. Each one of the lessons will have an associated [codepen](https://codepen.io/codercatdev) so you can [fork](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/forks/#:~:text=%23How%20to%20Fork,ready%20to%20save%20your%20changes.) the example and keep it for yourself!
