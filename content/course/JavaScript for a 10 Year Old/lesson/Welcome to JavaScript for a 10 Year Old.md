## Welcome

Hello and welcome to JavaScript for a 10 year old. Okay like all of our 10 year old courses it isnâ€™t truly just for 10 year olds. The idea is that you need to be old enough to know how to use a computer and set up the environment to be able to program in. If you are a season professional you will most likely know everything covered in this course, but it never hurts to browse through and find things that you may not know already.

## How to use the Course

People learn in a variety of different formats and at different speeds. I am a very visual learner and need to be able to break everything down into a picture in my head. Others find that just quickly listening and then coding on their own is the best way to learn. No matter which way you  learn my goal is to have the resources for you. If you find something is missing please join us on our [Learn Build Teach Discord](https://discord.gg/vM2bagU).

## How do I access the Course
