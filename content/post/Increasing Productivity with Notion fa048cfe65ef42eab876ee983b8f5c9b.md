# Productivity Weekend

While my wife was off to a Yoga retreat, my parents offered to take my son camping with a Halloween type of theme. So I thought "Wow I have a full day of uninterrupted focus!". I had lofty plans of finishing all the slides for our new [JAMStack Meetup](https://link.ajonp.com/jamstackgr), but then I started to realize that I wanted to instead jump back and focus on a couple of productivity things that I have been wishing I could handle instead.

## Notion.so

I searched high and low (okay a couple Google searches) for things that would replace AJonP's Trello Board, Google Keep, and OneNote. What I landed on was [notion.so](https://notion.so/) it provides me with a simple consolidated place that allows me to track the progress of all the videos I have in progress.

Notion has a great table view that allows you to quickly add any information just like in a Google Sheet.

### Calendar View

I can then get better about sense of release dates and hard deadlines that I can push myself towards in the calendar view. Here is an example of the videos that I am working towards.

The roadmap allows me to share out with AJ's Purr-fect Peeps that stats on changes that are happening on the site, something that I have not been able to provide in a public fashion up until now, so I really love this aspect. It allows a Trello like view into all the happenings for AJonP. Checkout [AJ's Roadmap](https://link.ajonp.com/roadmap)!

One of my favorite features by far is the [Notion Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en) which you can direct to any page type within your entire Notion system. So let's say that I am out on [Tyler McGinnis's React Course](https://link.ajonp.com/tylermcginnis-react) and I want to keep track of it. All I have to do is be on the page and click the Notion Web Clipper, then load it directly into my Notion Reading List. After I can always see what I have not categorized and setup many views to keep track.

### Markdown Export

The really big selling point for me is that Notion exports to markdown. Since it is available on every device that I own: MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android and works offline. It was pretty simple for me to choose! Now I can keep track of any notes export to .md and off it goes to my Gatsby Blog ????
