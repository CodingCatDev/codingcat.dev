title: Front End Web Development Podcasts
---

Have you ever wondered about getting started in web development? Want to know how those of us who have been doing it for years learn more?

I would highly recommend checking out the below podcasts. They are not only fun to watch but full of highly informative people as well.

Part of the [learn build teach](https://www.learnbuildteach.com/) mentality is also creating content like these podcasts. It helps you really grow as a person because you have to know so many different aspects of the web. On [Purrfect.dev](https://purrfect.dev/) we talk to such a variety of people about everything from hosting providers and database services, to front-end library supporters.

If you havenâ€™t already, check out [Purrfect.dev](https://purrfect.dev/) today, or join us on our Friday livestream [Code with Coding Cat](https://www.twitch.tv/codingcatdev).

### Alex's Thoughts

[Anthony](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev) and [Christopher](https://twitter.com/burnedchris) have such a light hearted yet hilarious way of distilling a lot of amazing information. You should for sure give [FSJam](https://twitter.com/FSJamOrg) a follow on twitter to stay updated with all the fun that comes from it.

[James Q Quick](https://twitter.com/jamesqquick) and [Amy Dutton](https://twitter.com/selfteachme) are amazing and also part of the Learn Build Teach community with myself and [Brittney Postma](https://twitter.com/BrittneyPostma) so I might be a little biased here, but this show is the ðŸ’£!

## Front End Happy Hour

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432310/main-codingcatdev-photo/7f77d549-35c4-4163-bc1c-47aec4dcb7d2.png)

### Alex's Thoughts

Front End Happy Hour has become my weekly cast. I enjoy how light the conversation remains, while the technical material is amazingly relevant. Of course it is easy to this when you have some of the top experts in some of the biggest Tech companies as guests.

## Syntax - Tasty Web

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432308/main-codingcatdev-photo/33796ce0-880f-46ee-9001-3c3e145c7f70.png)

[Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/): Full Stack Developers Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski dive deep into web development topics, explaining how they work and talking about their own experiences. They cover from JavaScript frameworks like React, to the latest advancements in CSS to simplifying web tooling.

### Alex's Thoughts

Syntax is hosted by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/@wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/@stolinski). Both are gifted teachers and have great tutorial based websites [wesbos.com](https://wesbos.com/) and [leveluptutorials.com](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) respectively. I usually catch up on these while running.

## JS Party

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432309/main-codingcatdev-photo/ded5012d-1dd0-466a-be5d-fe5309dfb8fa.png)

If JavaScript and/or the web touch your life, this showâ€™s for you. Some people search for JSParty and can't find the show, so now the string JSParty is in our description too.

### Alex's Thoughts

This really is a party, not in the sense everyone is filling up balloons all the time. It is more of the kind of party where all the Stranger Things get around a table and nerd out for a while! I really enjoy how empowering the episodes make you feel after listening.

## Developer Tea

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432308/main-codingcatdev-photo/9593fdca-be6d-4652-93fe-7bad6d8b8305.png)

[Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/) exists to help driven developers connect to their ultimate purpose and excel at their work so that they can positively impact the people they influence. With over 13 million downloads to date, Developer Tea is a short podcast hosted by [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/@jcutrell), co-founder of Spec and developer at [Clearbit](https://twitter.com/@Clearbit). We hope you'll take the topics from this podcast and continue the conversation, either online or in person with your peers.

### Alex's Thoughts

Jonathan's voice is so soothing, you won't be able to stop listening (be careful while driving). This podcast fits great on most commutes as it usually seems to be about 15 minutes or less (a few are longer). This podcast is basically yoga for my ears, it makes me settle down and really appreciate the goals that are constantly rolling around in my mind. As of writing this there are 720 episodes, I don't know how anyone can make that many so quickly, but they are all really well made and though out.

## Angular Air

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432310/main-codingcatdev-photo/3fee159d-9cea-406a-855c-661bc7cf44a3.png)

[AngularAir](https://angularair.com/) is a video podcast about the Google Angular platform hosted by Justin Schwartzenberger.

### Alex's Thoughts

Angular Air has a weird way of publishing their podcasts. So I will usually catch theirs on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdCOpvRk1lsBk26ePGDPLpQ), as it tends to be interactive which is awesome!

## Adventures in Angular

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432307/main-codingcatdev-photo/8f936229-2d4b-41d9-b5ad-81d10480221f.png)

[Adventures in Angular](https://topenddevs.com/podcasts/adventures-in-angular) is a weekly podcast about developments in the Angular community, tools, techniques, and ecosystem.

### Alex's Thoughts

Adventures in Angular is new for me but after listening to the latest with [Hans Larsen](https://twitter.com/@hanslatwork) and the work on the Angular CLI I am eager to work through the backlog, it is currently episode 252 so it might take me a minute.

## React Podcast

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432308/main-codingcatdev-photo/a6edb3d4-91da-4eda-a127-3ee09e091a12.png)

Conversations about React with your favorite developers.

### Alex's Thoughts

React Podcast is hosted by [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/@chantastic), in full honesty I haven't listened to a cast yet, but this came up as a suggestion since I am new to the ReactJS community. So it is now in my queue to learn a lot! I think this may not be active anymore

## ShopTalk

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432309/main-codingcatdev-photo/0b5f16f3-33cb-4986-b88d-3202881a4365.png)

[Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/): A live podcast about front end web design and UX.

### Alex's Thoughts

I found Shop Talk Show very recently and have been really enjoying it. [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) is a fun guy to listen to and his [site](https://daverupert.com/) is super awesome! If you don't know the name [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier), I am sure you have seen a thing he Co-founded called [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and used to run a small site called [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/). So lets just say they are really smart guys, that have on really smart

## Google Cloud Platform Podcast

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432307/main-codingcatdev-photo/9eacdcc7-6e92-4164-8901-b3a739a79ac0.png)

[The Google Cloud Platform Podcast](https://www.gcppodcast.com/) coming to you every week. Discussing everything on Google Cloud Platform from App Engine to Big Query.

### Alex's Thoughts

I am a huge Google Cloud fan so I try to catch up on all of these episodes. I will admit if there is something (like networking) I will often skip, until it is an episode geared more towards development.

## Y Combinator

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432308/main-codingcatdev-photo/2cab28aa-1953-4488-b058-12b5467d6ba4.png)

We talk with people who are shaping the future. A show about technology in business, research, and art.

### Alex's Thoughts

Y Combinator always keeps me up on what is happening next with technology in business. Yes I do have a day job and I need to stay in touch with the heartbeat of our economy!

## How I Built This with Guy Raz

![Untitled](https://media.codingcat.dev/image/upload/v1656432308/main-codingcatdev-photo/51f39d67-862a-4676-b508-67c61af443d7.png)

[How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/series/490248027/how-i-built-this): Guy Raz dives into the stories behind some of the world's best known companies. How I Built This weaves a narrative journey about innovators, entrepreneurs and idealistsâ€”and the movements they built.

### Alex's Thoughts

This is probably more for wanting to keep CodingCat.dev going, keeping anything as a side hustle takes work, so it helps to hear others story!
