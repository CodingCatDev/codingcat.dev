I have tried several sticker places and the images always come back terrible and the customer service stinks. Then I found Sticker Mule and everything has been like a dream!  
Check out all of their [custom stickers](https://www.stickermule.com/custom-stickers)​!

AJ may have gotten his paws on the keyboard while I was ordering our first set of stickers, but honestly they are such a great deal I still placed the order.

I was so impressed by how the stickers turned out that I had to get a logo for the new studio!
