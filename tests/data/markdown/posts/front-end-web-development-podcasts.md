I listen to all of my podcasts using [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), it makes my life easy to switch from mobile over to desktop super easy. I also love the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813) app designs. I am not affiliated with Pocket Casts at time of writing this blog. This list is in no particular order (yet).

> Like everything I try to always include the community, so if you have a podcast you want to share please throw me a [pull request](https://github.com/AJONPLLC/ajonp-content/tree/master/blog/frontend-web-development-podcasts.md)!

A podcast featuring panelists of engineers from [@Netflix](https://twitter.com/@Netflix), [@Evernote](https://twitter.com/@Evernote), [@Atlassian](https://twitter.com/@Atlassian) & [@LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/@LinkedIn) talking over drinks about all things Front End development.

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

Front End Happy Hour has become my weekly cast. I enjoy how light the conversation remains, while the technical material is amazingly relevant. Of course it is easy to this when you have some of the top experts in some of the biggest Tech companies as guests ????.

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

Syntax is hosted by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/@wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/@stolinski). Both are gifted teachers and have great tutorial based websites [wesbos.com](https://wesbos.com/) and [leveluptutorials.com](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) respectively. I usually catch up on these while ????.

A community celebration of JavaScript and the web. This show records LIVE on Thursdays at 1pm US/Eastern time.

If JavaScript and/or the web touch your life, this show’s for you. Some people search for JSParty and can't find the show, so now the string JSParty is in our description too.

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

This really is a party, not in the sense everyone is filling up balloons all the time. It is more of the kind of party where all the Stranger Things get around a table and nerd out for a while! I really enjoy how empowering the episodes make you feel after listening.

### Pocket Casts Description[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#pocket-casts-description)

We're [Emma Wedekind](https://twitter.com/@EmmaWedekind), [Kelly Vaughn](https://twitter.com/@kvlly), [Lindsey Kopacz](https://twitter.com/@LittleKope), and [Ali Spittel](https://twitter.com/@ASpittel) - four seasoned software developers working in different sectors. Since there's a major lack of technical podcasts out there, we've decided to start one. Just kidding -- there's already a ton! But, we wanted to add our voices to the space and share our diverse experiences and advice. We'll have great discussions around how to start coding, the hot technologies right now, how to get your first developer job, and more!

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

They hosts are absolute rock stars in the [#webdev](https://twitter.com/search?q=webdev) community! They are 9 episodes into the start of this podcast series, I can't wait to listen to more.

## Developer Tea[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#developer-tea)

### Pocket Casts Description[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#pocket-casts-description)

Developer Tea exists to help driven developers connect to their ultimate purpose and excel at their work so that they can positively impact the people they influence. With over 13 million downloads to date, Developer Tea is a short podcast hosted by [Jonathan Cutrell](https://twitter.com/@jcutrell), co-founder of Spec and developer at [Clearbit](https://twitter.com/@Clearbit). We hope you'll take the topics from this podcast and continue the conversation, either online or in person with your peers.

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

Jonathan's voice is so soothing, you won't be able to stop listening (be careful while driving). This podcast fits great on most commutes as it usually seems to be about 15 minutes or less (a few are longer). This podcast is basically yoga for my ears, it makes me settle down and really appreciate the goals that are constantly rolling around in my mind. As of writing this there are 720 episodes, I don't know how anyone can make that many so quickly, but they are all really well made and though out.

## The Web Platform Podcast[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#the-web-platform-podcast)

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

The Web Platform Podcast is one of my favorites, it was my weekly listen. They are releasing a little less regularly now, but still great guests and content.

AngularAir is a video podcast about the Google Angular platform hosted by Justin Schwartzenberger.

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

Angular Air has a weird way of publishing their podcasts. So I will usually catch theirs on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdCOpvRk1lsBk26ePGDPLpQ), as it tends to be interactive which is awesome!

## Full Stack Radio[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#full-stack-radio)

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

Full Stack Radio helps remind me as an aspiring front end developer, to remember the backend. I actually stumbled into this one because [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) is one of the creators of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and is a great author.

Adventures in Angular is new for me but after listening to the latest with [Hans Larsen](https://twitter.com/@hanslatwork) and the work on the Angular CLI I am eager to work through the backlog, it is currently episode 252 so it might take me a minute ????

I am a huge Google Cloud fan so I try to catch up on all of these episodes. I will admit if there is something (like networking) I will often skip, until it is an episode geared more towards development.

This is probably more for wanting to keep AJonP going ????, keeping anything as a side hustle takes work, so it helps to hear others story!

### Alex's Thoughts[](https://codingcat.dev/blog/front-end-web-development-podcasts#alexs-thoughts)

I might be a little biased on this one as I just started working here. However, the content is amazing! If you only listen to one checkout [Ep. 5 - Experience Design Week Recap](https://pca.st/sZs42J), I guarantee you will love the leprechaun tale, and how it fits into design and the digital world.
