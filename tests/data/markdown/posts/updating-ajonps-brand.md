Another evolution in the AJonP brand has come in the form of standardizing on acceptance. Making the most of neutral (non-stereotyped) colors. Taking a nod from Dev.to and updating AJ's tag to include a rainbow, as every mascot should have gender neutrality.

AJ will now be representing more people equally, and that is really important particularly to web development! We want a community that encourages everyone to share and learn together!
